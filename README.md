# Overview of the Project

The task is to build a dynamic webpage. A page that will accept user inputs and visually adjust to reflect users' search. This task was achieved by inserting a JavaScript into an HTML page. The exercise also involved building a table to hold/display the intended UFO data and we added filters beside the table to help users refine their search with one or more criteria (date, city, state, country and shape). 
We also used bootstrap and CSS to style the page with an attention grabbing header, an article summary and a brief article to produce a page that'd be visually appealling, informative and interactive. 

## Results

On the this page, the tittle and the headline are clearly displayed with a picture that depicts the purpose of the page in the background. Theres an article summary and a brief article that share individual views about the existence of UFOs. 

To make the webpage as interactive as possible, there are five search boxes beside the table which contains the UFO sighting data. With these filters, users can search the website using the date, city, country, state and/or shape to get information on UFO sightings.   

The first screenshot below shows a search based on date, 1/4/2010 and the second shows a search based on city, willow.

## Summary

#### Drawback

One draw back is the absence of a prompt from the filters during a search. The list of sightings we have in the data is not exhuastive, therefore some of the search criteria do not brinng up any information. However, there is no prompt in the search box to show that a search criteria has not information to show from the table. The user might be unawre and there's a chance they might think the filters don't work. 

#### Recommendations 

Including a code to show a message prompt in the filter box when there's not information for a search criteria will surely enhance user experience. 

A popup to show the number for each search result will also enhance user experince.
